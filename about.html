	<div class="boxed">My name is Parker Byrd and I am currently attending the University of North Carolina on a lacrosse scholarship.  
		I am a 3 time MIAA A Conference lacrosse champion, Under Armour Underclass All American, and ACC Champion. I find that my footwork, stick work, and lacrosse IQ is what has set me apart on the field. I want to pass along what has been taught to me to the next generation of defenders and give them training that I wish I had when I was their age. Almost every lacrosse camp or training session that I attended was offensive oriented. The only basic instruction I received on defense was to play good position, when in truth there is way more to it than that. 
		 
		Premier Defenders is an elite training program that is designed to improve players defensive skills including footwork, stick work, and field awareness. The knowledge and drills implemented have been accumulated over many years of playing, training, and talking with some of the brightest minds the game of lacrosse has ever had.
